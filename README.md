Subtask 3 involves rectifying errors in a partially written C++ program. Students receive flawed code intentionally, aiming to test their debugging skills. The task focuses on identifying and fixing syntax and logical errors in the provided code to meet specified functional requirements without necessitating the creation of a new GitHub project. This

exercise aims to assess students' debugging capabilities and their capacity to complete and correct code to achieve specified functionalities.

3. Instructions for the task

3.1 Sub-task 1: Creating Github repo and research on Morse code

Background:

(10)

In this subtask, you will continue using your GitHub account created during the first Practical Assessment Task (PAT). Your goal is to create a new GitHub repository and provide information about Morse code within the README.md file. This subtask will help you practice using version control and documentation on GitHub.

Create a New GitHub Repository:

Using your existing GitHub account from the previous PAT, create a new repository named "pat2-subtask1. This repository will be your space for completing this subtask and will also be used in Subtask 2.

Edit the README.md File:

After creating the repository, open the README.md file associated with the repository.

Edit the README.md file to include the following information about Morse code:

A brief overview of what Morse code is.

The historical context of why Morse code was created.

An explanation of how the Morse code system works, including the use of dots and dashes.

When providing this information, make sure to cite any resources you consulted for your research. Properly citing resources is important for academic and professional integrity.

Submission:

Complete PRACTICAL ASSESSMENT TASK 2: SUBTASK 1: WORKSHEET 1

Include the following:

A link to your GitHub repository "pat2-subtask1."

A screenshot showing the README.md file as it appears on your GitHub repository.

A copy of the README.md file in the provided worksheet.

Important Note:

Ensure that your README.md file is well-structured, contains clear explanations, provides valuable information about Morse code, and includes examples of words translated into Morse code.

Got it 👍 You’ve shared part of the NC(V) Introduction to Technical Programming Level 3 Student Guide (2024), specifically the section explaining Practical Assessment Task (PAT) 2 – Subtask 1 & 2.

Here’s a quick breakdown of what it’s asking you to do:

Sub-task 1: GitHub Repo & Research on Morse Code (10 marks)
Create a new GitHub repository called pat2-subtask1 using the GitHub account you already made in PAT 1.

Edit the README.md file in that repo:

Add:

A brief overview of Morse code.

Its historical context (why it was created).

Explanation of how it works (dots & dashes system).

Include citations/references for your research sources.

Submission requirements:

Provide the GitHub repo link.

A screenshot of your README.md on GitHub.

A copy of the README.md file in the worksheet.

✅ Important: Your README.md should be neat, clear, and even show examples of words in Morse code.

Sub-task 2: C++ Program for Morse Code Translation (30 marks)
This comes after Sub-task 1 (the text you shared cuts off here). It will involve:

Writing a C++ program that translates text into Morse code.

You’ll need to fix syntax and logical errors in some given faulty code (debugging task).

Would you like me to draft a sample README.md with:

Overview of Morse code,

Historical background,

Explanation of how it works, and

Example translations,

so you can just copy it into your GitHub repo?

Perfect ✅ Here’s a sample README.md draft you can use for Sub-task 1. You can copy-paste it into your GitHub repo’s README.md file:

Morse Code
Overview
Morse code is a method of communication that uses a series of dots (·) and dashes (–) to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. Each character in the alphabet is assigned a unique sequence of dots and dashes, making it possible to transmit information through sound, light, or written symbols.

Historical Context
Morse code was developed in the 1830s and 1840s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail to be used with the electric telegraph. It became the first widely used method of long-distance communication. For decades, it was essential for sending messages quickly across continents and oceans, especially before the invention of the telephone and the internet.

Morse code was also heavily used during World War I and II for military communication, as well as in aviation and maritime industries for distress signals (e.g., SOS = ··· ––– ···).

How Morse Code Works
Each letter of the alphabet and digit (0–9) has its own sequence of dots and dashes.

A dot (·) represents a short signal.

A dash (–) represents a long signal.

Spaces separate letters and words.

For example:

A = · –

B = – ···

C = – · – ·

1 = · – – – –

2 = ·· – – –

Morse code can be transmitted using sound (beeps), light (flashes), or written symbols.

Examples of Words in Morse Code
HELLO → ···· · ·–·· ·–·· –––

WORLD → ·–– ––– ·–· ·–·· –··

SOS → ··· ––– ···
